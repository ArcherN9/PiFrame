# PiFrame

Digital frames. We've seen a lot of them in the market. They come in varied sizes. Some with touch screens, mostly without. Some use a USB stick, some use micro SD cards. What if my photos are on a cloud rather than on a stick?

PiFrame is a RaspberryPi zero W powered digital frame that can either use pictures from a memory stick or connect to various cloud services. Its only been a few days since I started building this out & have decided to integrate with Microsoft OneDrive for an MVP. Will gradually add more features as the hardware takes its final form.

I'm primarily an Android developer & I would love all the help I can get with this DiY project.
